# The goal of our project was to create a new method of controlling an electric skateboard. Most electric skateboards use giant RC remotes that are bulky and the ones that aren't are quite expensive, so wii figured wii would use something everyone is familiar with: the Wii Nunchuk. The nunchuk joystick will control the motor operation, and perhaps if we have time we can find some uses for the buttons as well, maybe LEDs for night lighting or a second button to change settings of some kind.
